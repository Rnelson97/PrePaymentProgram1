# This is my first coding project. I currently work at a bank and got the idea to do a pre-payment calculator. a pre-payment clause in loan documentation states under 
certain criteria that if a customer pays down the loan they may face a penalty. this calculator is to show if you will pay a pre-payment penalty using the 
5-4-3-2-1 Prepayment clause.
